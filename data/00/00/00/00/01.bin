    Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment trying
    to figure out what is happening on a sprawling, ever-changing and 
    seemingly cursed Island. Tough but fair combat, responsive controls,
    challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll 
    to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic
    action game.
    Experience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching 
    paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat
    of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in 
    one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for
    successive runs; new paths you have unlocked, access to new levels, 
    mutations, abilities and weapons.
    Speaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay 
    your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but
    also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist.
    Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your 
    character differently with each and every run.
    At the end of the day though, it is your skills as a player that 
    matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills,
    until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park.
    Patience, you will get better! ...eventually.

    Features:
    - RogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world,
      with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping
      threat of permadeath.
    - 2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll,
      more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay... The 
      unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net
      makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. 
    - Nonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked,
      special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach
      your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, 
      your play style, or just your mood.
    - Exploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. 
      Take a moment to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea 
      mist infused air...
